        <p class="thirdtitle">Groupon is repositioning itself from a discount site to a bookable marketplace. I joined this product effort as a individual contributor initially and eventually took over leading this initiative. In two and a half years, I worked along product and engineering partners to identify and pain points and opportunity gaps. I facilitated design thinking exercises with cross-functional participants and helped develop hypothesis based on data & user research. I presented proposed concepts across the product organization, delivered designs in a agile fashion to see them brought to life across web, mobile web and native platforms.</p>

        <p class="thirdtitle">Customers love discounts and they came to Groupon for it. But after buying deals, they found it hard to redeem them - it required calling up the merchant and scheduling is difficult. Data showed that customers won’t buy a new deal until they’ve used the previous one. Customers need an easier way to check availabilities and book online.</p>

        <p class="smalllabel">THE MERCHANT PROBLEM</p>
        <p class="thirdtitle">Merchants hated discounts but discounts brought in customers. Merchants' strategy was to deep discount one or a few doorbuster products, in hope of converting first time customers into repeat customers. This model was effective yet created some problems. Many merchants did not have the technical skills or time to effectively manage their bookings or learning new tools. How do we enable merchants to offer booking, in the easiest way possible? </p>

    <div class="columns">
      <div class="column is-6 is-offset-one-quarter">
        <p class="thirdtitle">Adding bookability impacts the entire e-commerce funnel of discovery, conversion, transaction and post-purchase experience. My designs covered all of these areas but one of the most challenging piece was booking experience on the deal page. When consumers arrives here, they are deciding whether they want to buy the deal.
        <p class="thirdtitle">Groupon’s current deal page is the product of 10+ years of iterative design and development intended to quickly flow customers through a limited option purchase funnel as smoothly as possible. Any additional element on the deal page risks impact on conversion and requires careful considerations.

      <div class="column is-6 is-offset-one-quarter">
        <p class="thirdtitle">So we took a stepped approach - first, we want to see if there's any interest of booking. A jump-off was placed first as MVP - prominent enough that high-intent users won't miss it and will understand they can book while buying, while also being clear to low intent users who don't know when they want to use the deal that they can buy with confidence and worry about booking later.

    </div>
    <div class="columns">
      <div class="column is-6 is-offset-one-quarter">
        <p class="thirdtitle">The MVP design was very straight-forward with a focus on the messaging "Book a reservation now or later". The entire flow starts from the jump-off. Clicking on the jump-off will lead customers to another page where dates & times are selected. User can then check out with this reservation or without. 
        </p>       
        <p class="thirdtitle">MVP was rolled out as A/B tests first in international markets, then North American by market, first in mobile web, then desktop, then native by platform. Our hypothesis was proved - customers were interested in checking availabilities as they were making purchase decisions. We also learned that, customers convert better when a deal has high availability. This further lead down the path of solving the inventory issue on the merchant side.
        </p>
        <p class="thirdtitle">The 1.0 design was then rolled out - now with availability surfaced directly on deal page. In this round of tests, we had tracked the engagement rate on different area of the module. For example, we noticed that no one tapped on "see more date & times", which led us to trade the large CTA for a smaller one.

        <p class="thirdtitle">In this example, I had drawn out a service journey map, which we put in in front of all of our stakeholders. This had helped us get answers as we were trying to figure out how to enable bookability in our existing system so merchants make their existing deals bookable. </p>
        <p class="thirdtitle">The map demonstrated tasks of each human roles such as merchants themselves, Groupon operational managers, partner operational managers, customer service agents as well as tasks that were automated. It has touch points across the consumer experiences, sales, merchant business management, merchant product and deal management and Groupon internal operational tools. It captured various pieces that needed to be considered, designed and built for the whole thing to work cohesively.</p>

        <p class="thirdtitle">
         To envision the future state of Groupon's merchant platform, it’s unknown unknowns. We didn’t know whether a different service-centric model was necessarily going to out perform the deal-centric model. I developed a north star, that's built on the base of the north star developed by the merchant platform designers.  The goal of the north star was to inspire innovative changes, and to showcase possibilities that were not obvious solutions. I presented the north star in front of the entire product org together with my product partners.
