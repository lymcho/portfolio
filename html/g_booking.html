        <p class="thirdtitle">Customers love discounts. But they also need to be convenient. How Many people bought a groupon deal then never got around to use it?  In the long run, that’s not good customers and not good for Groupon, because people won’t buy a new deal until they’ve used the previous one. That’s why need Groupon to be Bookable. We want convenience, quality and loyalty. Merchants hate discounts. But they have to give discounts in exchange for exposure. How many merchants are willing offers a 50 to 75 percent discount without going out of business? It’s not an infinite list.  To increase inventory, we need to be a connect marketplace, a business model that allows merchants to sell on Groupon with low or no discounts. </p>

        </p>
        <p class="thirdtitle">lead with research, most people didn't buy because there's nothing they want to buy. If they didn't book, it's because thre arent' enough availabilities. why is that happening? with bookable vouchers, becaues merchants has a limit cap for how many discounted voucher they want to sell, there's very little availability for those. w</p>
        <p class="thirdtitle">[insert picture of data of likelihood to buy and booking tool problem] </p>    
        <p class="thirdtitle">hat shall we do? we want to increase inventory that's always available, and already bookable in nature: third party partnership. for many years, groupon actually had a lot of partners: xxx, xxx, xxx. but they were not successful, because cost effectiveness. Implementation cost too much, because each integration requires a new customized flow. The cycle is too long, cost a lot of engineering hours, the design is one-offs, they are all different, cost a even more enginnering hours to maintain. Over time, eventually they no longer maintained. </p>     
        <p class="thirdtitle">To solve this problem, the product strategy is to tackle this in 2 ways: 1.create 1 standard flow, in a modular way, after the design system is created, it will have a life of its own. 2. with all the partners we have, we have extremely high value partners but also a long tail of other partners. We wanted to create a self-service style integration model for those who want to integration with Groupon they can do most of the engineering work.</p>   
        <p class="thirdtitle">This is a huge product efforts, both efforts are brand new. I spent 2 years on this effort. I focused on the first piece first. </p>

        <p class="title">How do we enable merchants to offer online booking?
        </p>        
        <p class="thirdtitle">Merchants consider Groupon as a marketing tool as appose to a marketplace. Groupons is known for the model where they create hot deal that is deep discounted where it attracts people to their business with the discount. The business wants to retain merchants and acquire new merchants. The product and design goal is to create more value for merchants and improve their experience. It's a broader effort but There are 2 strateies I was focusing on.</p>
        <p class="thirdtitle">1. Acquire merchants who are already bookable. For example, in the uk, booksy...merchants already uses booksy to manage their day-to-day activities. </p>
        <p class="thirdtitle">use user research to validate merchants' needs and desires</p>
        <p class="thirdtitle">[insert graphic of value prop canvas]</p>
        <p class="thirdtitle">2. For existing merchant who already uses a tool, we could enable bookability for them, without having to use another groupon specific tool and manage their business using multiple platform.</p>
        <p class="thirdtitle">to do that, we need a complex flow behind the hood, that connects the consumer front, merchant business management front(salesforce), merchant product and deal management and groupon operational. There are various pieces needs to be designed and built for the whole thing to work cohesively, even thought from the merchant perspective, their deal just bookable one day.</p>
        <p class="thirdtitle">[insert graphic of service journey]</p>
        <p class="thirdtitle">There are many large conversations that have to happen cross-product. The use of prototypes and presentations at product demos.  </p>
        <p class="thirdtitle">Talk about pacing and different stage need to use different type: basic flow to rapidly get ideas down with group that's closest and understand the problem well, jot down thoughts. Use narrative prototypes effectively for presentations with a secondary audience. Always push for a diverse group of people early on. [the bit about people who think the same waste of time coursera]</p>

        </p>  
        <p class="thirdtitle">The Booking team was initially divided into 2 sub-groups. One that makes groupon-owned inventory bookable. The other focused on getting a lot of partnerships and bring in as much inventory as possible.the org didn't have any designers aligned to we had limited visibility into their strategy. how i built a relationship with the team and introduce them to design thinking. </p>      
        <p class="thirdtitle">one example is that the other team have different product roadmaps. one common problem of that is, we both need to build an experience in the receipt page that helps customer manage their bookings after they purchase. It's on our roadmap, but I involved the other designer to account for the usecases for them and we share each other's vision for the long run. This project is complex in that we had to manage all of the different states of it, across each consumer usecases, but have to account for cross-platform differences.  When I showed the designs to the engineering team, they've all appreciated our forward thinking and glad we avoided a lot of complex problems down the road.</p>
