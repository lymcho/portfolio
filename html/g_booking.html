        <p class="thirdtitle">Groupon was repositioning from a discount site to a bookable marketplace. It was a multi-year effort. I worked on several areas of booking as an individual contributor at first in 2019. In early 2021, I started leading this effort. I did IC work while project managing 2 other senior designers and a junior designer.

        <p class="thirdtitle">We took an iterative approach. As MVP, we placed a jump-off on the page. It was prominent enough that high-intent users wouldn't miss it. These customers would understand they could make bookings with their purchases. At the same time, we wanted to be clear to low-intent users that booking was not mandatory.  You could always buy this deal now and worry about booking later.

        <p class="thirdtitle"> A/B test results agreed with our hypotheses. Customers liked to check availabilities as they were making purchase decisions. We also learned that customers converted better when deals had high availability. This proved the importance of increasing bookable inventory.
        </p>
        <p class="thirdtitle">The second iteration surfaced date & times on the deal page. This made booking even more visible.  With this version, we also tracked the engagement rates on different areas of the module. For example, we noticed a low engagement rate on "see more date & times". This led us to trade the large call to action for a smaller one for the third iteration. The third iteration focused on optimizing messaging and a style refresh.

        <p class="thirdtitle">There was the "known unknown". We didn’t know how the features would work & where they would fit in but we knew who may have the answers. We needed to invite them to the table and help us fill in the gaps.

        <p class="thirdtitle">I created service journey maps to facilitate these conversations.
          The map, for example, demonstrated the flow of tasks needed to onboard a new bookable merchant. The roles included merchants, Groupon operational managers, partner operational managers, customer service agents and automatic bots. The touch points included consumer experiences, sales, merchant business management, merchant deal management and Groupon internal operational tools. Output of these discovery conversations then informed what we needed to build. </p>

        <p class="thirdtitle">Then there was the "unknown unknowns". We didn't know whether the merchant center would shift focus from a deal-centric model. I developed a north star to showcase the possibilities so we could align on our future visions.</p>
