        <p class="thirdtitle">Groupon was repositioning from a discount site to a bookable marketplace. It was a multi-year effort. I worked on booking as an individual contributor at first in 2019. In early 2021, I took over as the design lead. I was still doing IC work while project managing 2 other senior designers and a junior designer.

        <p class="thirdtitle">We took an iterative approach. As MVP, we placed a jump-off on the page. It was prominent enough that high-intent users wouldn't miss it. These customers would understand they could make bookings with their purchases. At the same time, we wanted to be clear to low-intent users that booking was not mandatory.  You could always buy this deal now and worry about booking later.

    <div class="columns">
      <div class="column is-6 is-offset-one-quarter">  
        <p class="thirdtitle"> A/B test results agreed with our hypotheses. Customers liked to check availabilities as they were making purchase decisions. We also learned that customers converted better when deals had high availability. This proved the importance of increasing bookable inventory.
        </p>
        <p class="thirdtitle">The second iteration surfaced date & times on the deal page. This made booking even more visible.  With this version, we also tracked the engagement rates on different areas of the module. For example, we noticed a low engagement rate on "see more date & times". This led us to trade the large call to action for a smaller one for the third iteration. The third iteration focused on optimizing messaging and a style refresh.
